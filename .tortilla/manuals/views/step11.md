# Step 11: Next Steps

[//]: # (head-end)


Congratulations on your newly built Meteor app!

Your app currently supports collaborating on a single todo list. To see how you could add more functionality, check out the Todos example—a more complete app that can handle sharing multiple lists. Also, try Local Market, a cross-platform customer engagement app that shows off native hardware functionality and social features.

```shell script
meteor create --example todos
meteor create --example localmarket
meteor create --react new-react-app
```

Here are some options for where you can go next:

1. Read the [Meteor Guide](https://guide.meteor.com/) to learn about best practices and useful community packages
2. Check out the [complete documentation](https://docs.meteor.com/)
3. Explore additional Meteor tutorials like [WhatsApp clone](https://www.angular-meteor.com/tutorials/whatsapp/meteor/bootstrapping) and [Intermediate Meteor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI8IslJHSag&list=PLLnpHn493BHFYZUSK62aVycgcAouqBt7V)
